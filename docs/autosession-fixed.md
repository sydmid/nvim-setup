# AutoSession - Fixed Configuration & Best Practices

## Summary of Changes Made

### üîß Fixed Issues

1. **Keybinding Conflicts Resolved**:
   - Moved AutoSession from `<leader>w*` to `<leader>s*` to avoid conflicts with tab navigation
   - `<leader>wp` was conflicting between "Purge sessions" and "Previous tab"

2. **Automatic Session Saving Implemented**:
   - Added best-practice automatic saving on focus loss
   - Implemented 5-minute timer-based auto-save for idle periods
   - Smart directory filtering to avoid saving in temporary/home directories
   - Auto-save only when meaningful buffers are open

3. **Enhanced Configuration**:
   - Better error handling and session cleanup
   - Improved notification system
   - Optimized session restoration behavior

### üìã New Keybindings (Session Management)

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `<leader>ss` | `:SessionSave` | Save current session |
| `<leader>sr` | `:SessionRestore` | Restore session for current directory |
| `<leader>sf` | `:SessionSearch` | Find/Restore session (Telescope) |
| `<leader>sd` | `:SessionDelete` | Delete current session |
| `<leader>sD` | `:SessionDelete {name}` | Delete specific session |
| `<leader>sS` | `:SessionSave {name}` | Save session with custom name |
| `<leader>st` | `:SessionToggleAutoSave` | Toggle automatic saving on/off |
| `<leader>sp` | `:SessionPurgeOrphaned` | Clean up orphaned sessions |

### üîÑ Alternative Quick Access

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `<leader>se` | `:SessionSave` | Save session (alias) |
| `<leader>sl` | `:SessionRestore` | Load session (alias) |
| `<leader>so` | `:SessionSearch` | Open session picker (alias) |

### üè∑Ô∏è Preserved Tab Navigation

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `<leader>wo` | `:tabnew` | Open new tab |
| `<leader>wn` | `:tabn` | Go to next tab |
| `<leader>wp` | `:tabp` | Go to previous tab |
| `<leader>wf` | `:tabnew %` | Open current buffer in new tab |

## üöÄ Automatic Session Features

### Smart Auto-Save Triggers
1. **On Focus Lost**: Saves when you switch away from Neovim
2. **On Exit**: Always saves when leaving Neovim
3. **Timer-Based**: Auto-saves every 5 minutes during idle periods
4. **Smart Filtering**: Only saves in meaningful project directories

### Auto-Save Conditions
- ‚úÖ Saves when 1+ meaningful file buffers are open
- ‚úÖ Skips home directory and common temporary locations
- ‚úÖ Saves all modified files before creating session
- ‚úÖ Includes git branch information in session names

### Suppressed Directories (No Auto-Save)
- `~/` (Home directory)
- `~/Projects` (Project root)
- `~/Downloads`
- `~/Desktop`
- `~/Documents`
- `/tmp`, `/`, `/Users`, `/usr`, `/opt`, `/System`

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Basic Session Functionality
```bash
# Open a project directory
cd ~/your-project
nvim

# In Neovim:
:lua print("Testing AutoSession...")
```

### 2. Test Manual Session Commands
```vim
" Save current session
<leader>ss

" Find and restore sessions
<leader>sf

" Save with custom name
<leader>sS my-custom-session

" Delete current session
<leader>sd
```

### 3. Test Automatic Saving
1. Open Neovim in a project directory
2. Open several files
3. Switch away from Neovim (e.g., to another app)
4. Return to Neovim - should see "Session saved" notification
5. Close and reopen Neovim in same directory - session should restore

### 4. Test Telescope Integration
```vim
" Open session picker
<leader>sf

" Navigation in picker:
" - Use j/k to navigate
" - Enter to restore session
" - Ctrl+D to delete session
" - Ctrl+Y to copy session
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Keybindings Don't Work
1. Restart Neovim completely
2. Check for plugin conflicts: `:Lazy health`
3. Verify Which-Key shows session group: `<leader>s`

### If Auto-Save Doesn't Work
1. Check if in a suppressed directory
2. Verify you have meaningful file buffers open
3. Check notifications are enabled
4. Test manual save first: `<leader>ss`

### If Sessions Don't Restore
1. Check session directory: `:lua print(require('auto-session').get_root_dir())`
2. Verify git branch matches (if using git)
3. Check for conflicting plugins

## üìä Session Management Best Practices

### Workflow Recommendations
1. **Let auto-save handle routine saving** - don't manually save unless needed
2. **Use custom names for experimental work** - `<leader>sS experiment-feature`
3. **Clean up regularly** - `<leader>sp` to purge old sessions
4. **Use Telescope picker** - `<leader>sf` for quick project switching
5. **Branch-specific sessions** - automatic git branch inclusion

### Directory Structure
```
~/.local/share/nvim/sessions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-name_main.vim       # Main branch session
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-name_feature.vim    # Feature branch session
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom-session-name.vim     # Custom named session
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] No keybinding conflicts with tab navigation
- [ ] Session saving works manually (`<leader>ss`)
- [ ] Auto-save triggers on focus loss
